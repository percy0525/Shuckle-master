In the beginning, you will hear one single voice in an octave including half step and whole tone. 

Try your best to figure out the pitch of this voice as many times as possible!

### Second -> Rhythm
Rhythm generally means a movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions.

Listen to the rhythm carefully, and then repeat again by yourself!
There are different difficulties. Open your ears and be patient.
